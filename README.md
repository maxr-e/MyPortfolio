# My Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my Portfolio Page! Here I showcase my projects and technical accompishments. My jounrney through the world of coding is charted, and I am proud to show my growth and development.
While I have pivoted from a career in biology to software development, I see several similarities such as levels of  complexity, classification, dynamic interactions and evolution. I look forward watching this project grow!
